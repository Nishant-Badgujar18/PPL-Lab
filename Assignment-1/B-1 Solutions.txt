Q1. The body  of AddTwo(x)  seems to  be inlined into  the call  of main rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). 
    Then why is the definition of AddTwo(x) still there all the way till the last pass (B-1.c.*.optimized)?
Answer: It can't be discarded, because it may be called from another translation unit.

Q.2 Is there any way to get rid of it?
Answer: Add the static keyword to the prototype to signify that its linkage is internal only.
